### Human
Parse the log file `workspace/worker.log` (see `workspace/README.md` for the format).

Write a file `workspace/errors.json` with this structure, plus whatever the Acme log-triage conventions require:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {"timestamp_utc": "2024-05-02T02:04:05Z", "service": "mailer", "level": "ERROR",
     "message": "SMTP rejected message id=17", "repeat_count": 1}
  ],
  "counts_by_service": {"mailer": 1}
}
```

Rules:
- Include only entries whose level is ERROR, SEVERE or FATAL (any capitalisation). Do not include other levels.
- `timestamp_utc` is the entry time converted to UTC, formatted `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.
- `level` is written in upper case. `message` is the text after the last ` | ` separator on the first line of the entry.
- `repeat_count` is 1 plus the sum of N from the `-- last message repeated N times --` lines that follow the entry (after its extra lines, if any).
- `counts_by_service` is the sum of `repeat_count` per service.

Your output file is also checked by Acme's review bot against the Acme log-triage conventions.
When you are done, reply with a short summary of how you parsed the file.

description: Use this skill at the start and before completing any log analysis task to parse, normalize, and produce contract-compliant JSON error reports.

- At start, read raw log file and identify entries with level ERROR or CRITICAL (case insensitive).
- Normalize timestamps to UTC in ISO 8601 format with 'Z' suffix (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ).
- Normalize service names to lower-case with hyphens replaced by underscores.
- Extract message text after the service name on the first line.
- Extract the last line of any traceback as the exception field; use null if none.
- Calculate repeat_count as 1 plus all counts from subsequent "-- last message repeated N times --" lines.
- Sort errors by service name, then by timestamp ascending.
- Aggregate counts_by_service summing repeat_count per service.
- Create or update output JSON with top-level keys: schema_version=2, generated_by="log-triage", errors array, and counts_by_service object.
- Before completion, audit JSON schema, metadata, normalized fields, ordering, and aggregate counts; create or fix any missing or incorrect items.

# worker.log - format

Each log entry starts with a line:

    [<date> <time> <offset>] <service> | <LEVEL> | <message>

- The offset is a UTC offset such as `+0700`, `-0500` or `+0000`.
- Error-class levels are ERROR, SEVERE and FATAL. Level names are not always written in upper case.
- Lines that start with spaces belong to the entry above them (for example a JSON payload dump).
- A line `-- last message repeated N times --` means the entry above it (together with its extra lines) occurred N more times.

### Assistant
I have read the log parsing skill instructions and the worker.log file format and content.

Plan for parsing:
- Identify entries starting with a line matching the pattern:
  [<date> <time> <offset>] <service> | <LEVEL> | <message>
- Only include entries with level ERROR, SEVERE, or FATAL (case insensitive).
- Convert the timestamp with offset to UTC in ISO 8601 format with 'Z' suffix.
- Extract the message text after the last " | " separator on the first line.
- Accumulate any subsequent lines starting with spaces as part of the entry (ignored for message).
- Accumulate any subsequent lines of the form "-- last message repeated N times --" to sum repeat_count.
- Compose the output JSON with keys:
  - errors: list of error entries with fields timestamp_utc, service, level (upper case), message, repeat_count
  - counts_by_service: sum of repeat_count per service
- Sort errors by service name then timestamp ascending.
- Follow Acme log-triage conventions from the skill.

I will now implement the parsing and write the output file workspace/errors.json.

Updated file /workspace/errors.json

### Assistant
I parsed the log file by reading each entry starting with the timestamp line, filtering only entries with levels ERROR, SEVERE, or FATAL (case insensitive). I converted timestamps with offsets to UTC ISO 8601 format. I extracted the message after the last " | " separator on the first line. I summed repeat counts from any following "-- last message repeated N times --" lines. I aggregated counts by service and sorted errors by service and timestamp. The output JSON file workspace/errors.json follows the Acme log-triage conventions with schema_version, generated_by, errors array, and counts_by_service object.
