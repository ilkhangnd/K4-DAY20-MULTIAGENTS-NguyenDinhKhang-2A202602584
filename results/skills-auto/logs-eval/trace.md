### Human
Parse the log file `workspace/worker.log` (see `workspace/README.md` for the format).

Write a file `workspace/errors.json` with this structure, plus whatever the Acme log-triage conventions require:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {"timestamp_utc": "2024-05-02T02:04:05Z", "service": "mailer", "level": "ERROR",
     "message": "SMTP rejected message id=17", "repeat_count": 1}
  ],
  "counts_by_service": {"mailer": 1}
}
```

Rules:
- Include only entries whose level is ERROR, SEVERE or FATAL (any capitalisation). Do not include other levels.
- `timestamp_utc` is the entry time converted to UTC, formatted `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.
- `level` is written in upper case. `message` is the text after the last ` | ` separator on the first line of the entry.
- `repeat_count` is 1 plus the sum of N from the `-- last message repeated N times --` lines that follow the entry (after its extra lines, if any).
- `counts_by_service` is the sum of `repeat_count` per service.

Your output file is also checked by Acme's review bot against the Acme log-triage conventions.
When you are done, reply with a short summary of how you parsed the file.


MANDATORY SKILL ACTIVATION: before reading or changing workspace files, use read_file to read every available skills/*/SKILL.md. Every applicable checklist item is an acceptance criterion, not a suggestion: implement it even when visible tests already pass. Before your final response, verify every applicable checklist item and create every required artifact.

# worker.log - format

Each log entry starts with a line:

    [<date> <time> <offset>] <service> | <LEVEL> | <message>

- The offset is a UTC offset such as `+0700`, `-0500` or `+0000`.
- Error-class levels are ERROR, SEVERE and FATAL. Level names are not always written in upper case.
- Lines that start with spaces belong to the entry above them (for example a JSON payload dump).
- A line `-- last message repeated N times --` means the entry above it (together with its extra lines) occurred N more times.

### Assistant
I have read the log file and the format instructions. I will now parse the log file according to the rules:

- Include only entries with level ERROR, SEVERE, or FATAL (case insensitive).
- Convert the timestamp to UTC in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ.
- Normalize the service name to lower case with '-' replaced by '_'.
- Extract the level in upper case.
- Extract the message as the text after the last " | " separator on the first line of the entry.
- Calculate repeat_count as 1 plus the sum of N from subsequent "-- last message repeated N times --" lines.
- Aggregate counts by service summing repeat_count.
- Sort errors by service, then timestamp_utc ascending.
- Add top-level keys "schema_version": 2 and "generated_by": "log-triage".

I will now implement the parsing and write the output file workspace/errors.json.

### Tool result
Updated file /workspace/errors.json

### Assistant
I parsed the log file by reading each entry and filtering only those with levels ERROR, SEVERE, or FATAL (case insensitive). I converted timestamps to UTC in the required format, normalized service names, extracted the message from the first line, and calculated repeat_count including repeated message lines. I aggregated counts by service and sorted the errors by service and timestamp. The output file workspace/errors.json includes the required schema_version and generated_by fields as per Acme log-triage conventions.
