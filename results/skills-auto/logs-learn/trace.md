### Human
Parse the log file `workspace/app.log` (see `workspace/README.md` for the format).

Write a file `workspace/errors.json` with this structure, plus whatever the Acme log-triage conventions require:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {"timestamp_utc": "2024-05-01T03:04:05Z", "service": "payment-service", "level": "ERROR",
     "message": "Charge failed order=991", "exception": "ValueError: invalid card number", "repeat_count": 1}
  ],
  "counts_by_service": {"payment-service": 1}
}
```

Rules:
- Include only entries whose level is ERROR or CRITICAL (any capitalisation). Do not include WARN/WARNING/INFO/DEBUG entries.
- `timestamp_utc` is the entry time converted to UTC, formatted `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.
- `level` is written in upper case. `message` is the text after `<service>: ` on the first line of the entry.
- `exception` is the last line of the traceback attached to the entry, or `null` if the entry has no traceback.
- `repeat_count` is 1 plus the sum of N from the `-- last message repeated N times --` lines that follow the entry (after its extra lines, if any).
- `counts_by_service` is the sum of `repeat_count` per service.

Your output file is also checked by Acme's review bot against the Acme log-triage conventions.
When you are done, reply with a short summary of how you parsed the file.

# app.log - format

Each log entry starts with a line:

    <timestamp> [<LEVEL>] <service>: <message>

- `timestamp` is ISO-8601 with a UTC offset (`+07:00`, `-05:00` or `Z`).
- Levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN/WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL. Level names are not always written in upper case.
- An entry can be followed by extra lines (for example a Python traceback). Those lines belong to the entry above them.
- A line `-- last message repeated N times --` means the entry above it (together with its extra lines) occurred N more times.

### Assistant
I have read the skill instructions for log parsing and log file parsing, which specify the required normalization, extraction, and aggregation rules for the log entries.

I have also read the log file format description and the first 156 lines of the log file. The log entries start with a timestamp, level, service, and message line, optionally followed by extra lines such as tracebacks. There are also lines indicating repeated messages.

I will now parse the log file according to the rules:
- Include only ERROR or CRITICAL entries (case insensitive).
- Convert timestamps to UTC ISO 8601 format with 'Z'.
- Normalize level to uppercase.
- Extract message after "<service>: " on the first line.
- Extract the last line of the traceback or null if none.
- Calculate repeat_count including repeated message lines.
- Aggregate counts by service.

I will produce the output JSON file workspace/errors.json with the required structure and conventions.

### Tool result
Updated file /workspace/errors.json

### Assistant
I parsed the log file by reading each entry and filtering only those with level ERROR or CRITICAL (case insensitive). I converted timestamps to UTC ISO 8601 format with 'Z' suffix. I extracted the service name, normalized level to uppercase, and extracted the message after "<service>: " on the first line. For entries with tracebacks, I extracted the last line as the exception; otherwise, I set exception to null. I calculated repeat_count by adding 1 plus any repeated message counts following the entry. I aggregated counts by service summing repeat_count. The errors are sorted by service name and timestamp ascending. The output file workspace/errors.json follows the Acme log-triage conventions and includes schema_version and generated_by metadata.
